Hello, it has been awhile since I’ve posted anything in my “journal” folder and I thought it might be a good idea to start dusting it off and begin using it again. I’m not going to section the entries into weekly folders anymore, that’ll only be with the exception of the first week. 

Anyways, these past few weeks I’ve covered a number of concepts; from what collections are on a conceptual level, to referencing and assigning elements, through working with simple loops and finally using Ruby’s built-in iterative methods to solve problems.

I’m trying to gain a clear understanding of collections on both a conceptual and practical level since it is a fundamental piece of knowledge, both in Ruby and in programming in general.

Here are some important points that I need to remember:

* Some of the most commonly used iterative methods are `each`, `select`, and `map`. It is important to understand the difference between these methods.

* Methods called on Ruby collection objects are often used with a block; the return value of the block is passed back to the method on each iteration. It is important to be aware of:

1. What the method does with the block’s return value
2. What the ultimate return value of the method is
3. Any side-effects that the code in the block may have

* Ruby provides a lot of other useful methods for working with collection. It is not necessary to memorize all of them at this stage, but I should:

1. Be aware that they exist and know where to look for them
2. Know how to read the documentation in order to understand the method’s return value, how it uses the block’s return value (if it takes a block), and whether the method is destructive.

## My Quiz Results
After studying for a minute, my quiz results ended up being in 70% which is fine. I get so much anxiety from taking these quizzes, but it’s good to fill in gaps in my knowledge. Most of the questions at the end were tough, but here are a few that I got wrong..

### Question 9**
Read the below statements regarding `map` and identify all the statements which are correct. Assume that the block does not mutate the array.

**B & C** were the correct answers. 

**A**. The return value in this situation would be an array containing `nil`s; one `nil` for each item in the original array.
**D.** When `map` is called with a block on a hash, the return value of the method is an array (*not a new hash*) 

### Question 12

Within the code below, identify the method represented by `some_method`:

```rb
['a', 'b', 'c'].some_method do |item|
  puts item
end
# => []
```

**B** was the correct answer because `puts item` returns `nil` which is evaluated as falser, therefore using `select` would return an empty array. (**I’m so mad that I didn’t catch this one**)

My answer is wrong because `each` would return the original array instead. 

### Question 16

Carefully examine the following code example

```rb 
pets = ['cat', 'parrot', 'dog', 'fish']
pets.map do |pet|
  pet.size == 3
end
```

Based on your observations of the code example, select all statements below which are true.

**A&C** were the correct answers because the return value of the block, which will be `true` or `false` *is* considered and in fact is used to populate a *new* array that is returned by the call to `map`.

**D** is wrong. This would be a description of *selection* but map performs *transformation*, in this case replacing each array item with a boolean.

### Question 17 

Carefully examine the following code example.

```rb
flavors = ['chocolate', 'strawberry', 'mint', 'vanilla']
flavors.reject { |flavor| puts flavor }
```

Based on your observations of the code example, select all statements which are true.

**D** Like `Array#select`, `Array#reject` is only interested in the *truthiness* of the block’s return value, though in the case of `reject` it returns the items for which the block is *not* `true`, or in other words is *falsy*

**A, B & C** `Array#reject` *does* consider the return value of the block; since in this case the return value will be `nil` in each case, this will always be evaluated as *falsy* and so the array that is returned contains all of the flabor strings. The array returned by `reject` it is a *new* array however, and not the original `flavors` array.

As a side note, I want to be able to score higher on my next quizzes. I feel that there are many areas that I am weak in and I need to spend more time carefully reviewing material. I get very anxious whenever I take quizzes (and maybe a little *let* down that I wasn’t as knowledgable as I thought I was), but I hope to be better in due time. Just takes time and patience. My next approach for the Ruby: Advanced Collections is to spend time learning all of the material in the courses and then reviewing them over a span of a week to ensure a high score when I take the quiz.
