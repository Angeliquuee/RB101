# Repeat Yourself
Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and prints the string as many times as the integer indicates.

Example:
```rb
repeat('Hello', 3)

# Output:
# Hello
# Hello
# Hello
```

I remember using the times method in CodeAcademy, so Iâ€™ll use it in my solutions. The `puts` method will also print our string into the console with the new line, which will reach our desired output.

```rb
def repeat(string, integer)
  integer.times { puts "#{string}" }
end

repeat('Hello', 3)
```

## Launch School Solution & Discussion
### Solution

```rb
def repeat(string, number)
	number.times do 
   puts string
  end
end
```

### Discussion 

When solving exercises, it can be beneficial to progress in small increments. We started out by defining `repeat` with two parameters. Then, to ensure everything worked properly, we added `puts string` inside the method and ran the code.

```rb
def repeat(string, number)
	puts string
end
```

This works correctly, however, it only prints `string` once. Our goal is to print `string` a specified number of times. One of the more suitable methods for this situation is `Integer#times`. Using this method, we can execute `puts string` any number of times. In this case, we want to print `string` the number of times indicated by `number`.
