# Stop Counting
The method below counts from 0 to 4. Modify the block so that it prints the current number and stops iterating when the current number equals `2`.

```rb
5.times do |index|
  # ...
end
```

### My Solution

```rb 
5.times do |index|
	puts index
  break if index == 2
end
```

### Solution

```rb
5.times do |index|
  puts index
  break if index == 2
end
```

### Discussion

The `times` method count from 0 to one less than the specified number. In this case, that number is 5. The block parameter `index` represents the current iteration number. We can print the current number with `puts index`.

To stop the loop, we can simply add `break`. However, we want to to only stop iterating when the current number equals `2`. We can do this by adding the `if index == 2` condition to `break`.

### Further Exploration

Without running this code, how many values will be printed?

```rb 
5.times do |index|
  puts index 
  break if index == 4
end 
```

5 values will be printed and this is because the iteration that captures the integer 4 will not be skipped, it will only evaluate it and then break the loop entirely after the conditional evaluates to true.

Now, consider this code:

```rb 
5.times do |index|
  puts index 
  break if index < 7
end
```

How many values will be printed this time?

One value, and thatâ€™s 0.
