# Insert Numbers
Modify the code below so that the user’s input gets added to the `numbers` array. Stop the loop when the array contains 5 numbers.

```rb
numbers = []

loop do
  puts 'Enter any number:'
  input = gets.chomp.to_i
end

puts numbers
```

### My Solution

```rb 
numbers = []

loop do
  puts 'Enter any number:'
  input = gets.chomp.to_i
	numbers.push(input)
	break if numbers.size == 5
end

puts numbers
```

### Discussion

When dealing with user input, it’s likely the input will either be evaluated or added to something. In this case, we’re adding an integer to an array `Array#push` works well for this because it will take the value of `input` and add it to the end of the `numbers` array, which is exactly what we need.

Now that we are handling the input properly, the next step is stop the loop. We can accomplish this by taking advantage of the `Array#size` method. `#size` returns the number of elements contained in the caller. To stop the loop when `numbers` contains 5 elements, we can simply add a `break` with an `if numbers.size == 5` condition.
