# while Loops
Locate the description of the `while` loop in the ruby documentation

Based off of the previous exercise `01_where_to_find_documentation` we are instructed to use `(https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/)` as our main source for documentation. 

We will simply click on Ruby Master and if we scroll down, we can locate the documentation for the while Loop if we click on control_expressions. 

From there, we can use the Command + F on Mac or Ctrl + F on Windows to pin point where the while Loop documentation is in this specific page.  

[control_expressions - Documentation for Ruby master](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop)

And voila ~ there you have it!

## Launch School Solution & Discussion

### Solution

1. Select the core API link for your version of ruby.
2. Select the “control expressions” link.
3. Search within the page for “while” until you find the “while loop” discussion.

### Discussion

The hard part of this exercise is knowing exactly where to go; documentation for what we like to think of as “the ruby language” can be difficult to find until we know where to look. The “control expressions” page is where you will find discussions of most language features that control code flow: conditions (`if`, `unless`,`case`), basic looping (`while`, `until`, `for`), loop termination (`break`, `next`), and several other features of the language
