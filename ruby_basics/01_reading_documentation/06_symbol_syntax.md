# Symbol Syntax
Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a **Symbol** that represents your name. We arenâ€™t looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which is one of rubyâ€™s datatypes.

â€¦ Hmm, oh! This is easy. Itâ€™s actually just `:Angelica`. Thanks to CodeAcademy ðŸ˜ƒ I remembered this specific syntax.

Anything that is prepended with a `:` is a symbol in Ruby..
