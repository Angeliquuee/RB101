# Return Value of while
Using the ruby documentation, determine what value a `while` loop returns.

It states in the ruby documentation which can be found here (https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop) which is handy from our previous exercise… 

It states that the result of a `while` loop is `nil` unless `break` is used to supply a value.

## Launch School Solution & Discussion 

### Solution

`nil` unless break is used, in which case the value passed to `break` is used.

### Discussion

The `while` loop documentation is on the “control expressions” page. This documentation tells you how the return value is arrived at.
