# Say Hello
Modify the code below so `”Hello!"` is printed 5 times!

```rb 
say_hello = 0

while say_hello > 5
	puts "Hello!"
	say_hello += 1
end
```

### My Solution

```rb 
say_hello = 0

while say_hello
	puts "Hello!"
	say_hello += 1
  break if say_hello >= 5
end
```

### Solution

```rb
say_hello = true
count = 0

while say_hello
  puts 'Hello!'
  count += 1
  say_hello = false if count == 5
end
```

### Discussion

Loops are used regularly in Ruby, therefore, it’s important to understand how to control them based on the program’s conditions. In this exercise, the `while` loop is set to run based on the condition of `say_hello`. Since `say_hello` was initialized as `true`, the loop will execute at least once. Upon the first iteration, however, `say_hello` is set to `false`. Therefore, when `while` evaluates the condition of `say_hello` on the second iteration, it won’t execute the block because `say_hello` equals `false`.

Now that we understand how this `while` loop works, we need to modify it to fit the requirements. In this case, we need to only change `say_hello` to `false` if we’ve said `”Hello!”` 5 times. We can accomplish this by adding a counter variable and `if` condition. We need `count` to track the number of times the loop has executed. Once `count` reaches 5, our `if` condition will evaluate too `true`.

We use Ruby’s shorthand way of writing the `if` condition but it could also be written like this:

```rb 
if count == 5
	say_hello = false 
end
```

Our solution works well, but there are simpler ways of accomplishing the same thing.

```rb 
5.times do
	puts "Hello!"
end 
```

Although using `#times` may be simpler and lets you write less code, it’s still important to understand the fundamentals of how a method like `#times` actually works. Just keep in mind that there’s usually more than one way to accomplish a given task.
