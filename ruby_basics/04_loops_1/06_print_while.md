# Print While
Using a `while` loop, print 5 random numbers between 0 and 99. The code below shows an example of how to begin solving this exercise.

```rb 
numbers = []

while <condition>
  # ...
end
```

Example output (your numbers will most likely be different):
```
62
96
31
16
36
```

### My Solution

```rb
numbers = []

while numbers.length < 5
  numbers << rand(100)
end

puts numbers
```

### Approach/Algorithm

The method `Kernel#rand` does a nice job of returning a random number.

### Solution

```rb 
numbers = []

while numbers.size < 5
  numbers << rand(100)
end 

puts numbers
```

### Discussion

Implementing a `while` loop that iterates under set conditions should be fairly trivial. The more difficult part of this exercise is, perhaps, getting random numbers and keeping track of them. To accomplish this, we use `#rand`. This method works well because it returns a random number between 0 and one less than the number provided. In this case, that number is `100`.

Once the random number is returned, we want to avoid printing it immediately. If we simply printed the returned number, `while` would iterate infinitely. Instead, we want to add the returned number to an array. This way, we can tell `while` to stop iterating after 5 numbers have been added to the array.
