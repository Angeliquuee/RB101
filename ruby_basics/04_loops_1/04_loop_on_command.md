# Loop on Command
Modify the code below so the loop stops iterating when the user inputs `'yes’`.

```rb 
loop do
	puts "Should I stop looping?"
	answer = gets.chomp
end 
```

```

### Discussion

This is a practical example of how a loop can be used to retrieve and handle user input. In the initial code, the loop continue iterating regardless of the input’s value. To change that, we add `break` with an `if` condition. The condition, in this case, needs to be `answer == 'yes'`. This tells `break` to only execute if the input value is `'yes'`.

We added a simple error message after `break` to demonstrate that `break` doesn’t have to be at the end of the loop to do its job. Also, providing an error message can be useful in providing a better user experience when dealing with inputs.
